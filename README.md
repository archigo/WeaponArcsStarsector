# Weapon Arcs

This is a mod for the game Starsector, which draws all the weapon arcs of the player ship, not just the ones from the currently selected weapon group. This is especcially usefull when selecting a missile weapon group, while still needing to aim other weapons.

**Config**

In weapon-arcs-settings.json you can change to color of the weapons arcs, and set options to auto enable arcs on weapon groups.
Additionally you can set the roughness of the displayed weapon arc. For more smooth arch, set a lower number (minimum 1. This will draw for each degree in the arc). For a blocky arc, set a higher number (don't go over 50).
